# Prime Factorization

In number theory, integer factorization is the decomposition of a composite number into a product of smaller integers, which are called factors. If these factors are further ristricted to prime numbers, the process is call prime factorization.

## What is prime number and composite number?
A prime number is a whole number greater than 1, and have and only have two factors: 1 and the number itself.

## What is the relation between prime numbers and composite numbers?
Prime Numbers are the basic building blocks of all numbers. Composite Numbers are made up of Prime Numbers multiplied together.
