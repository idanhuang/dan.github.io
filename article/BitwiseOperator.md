## What is bit?
A bit is the smallest unit of information that can be stored or manipulated on a computer. The name is a portmanteau of binary digit. The bit represents a logical state with on of two possible values. These values are most commonly represented as either 0 or 1, but other represtations such as true/false, yes/no, +/- or on/off are commom.


- Bitwise operators
Bitwise operations are similar to the logical operations. Logical operators work on boolen expressions and return boolean values, while bitwise operators work on binary digit of integer values (long, int, short, char and byte) and return an integer.


- & (bitwise AND)
It takes two numbers as operands and does AND on every bit of the two numbers. The result of AND is 1 only if both bits are 1.

- | (bitwise OR)
It takes two numbers as operands and does OR on every bit of the two numbers. The result of OR is 1 if any of the two bits is 1.

- ^ (bitwise XOR)
It takes two numbers as operands and does XOR on every bit of the two numbers. The result of XOR is 1 if the two bits are different.

- ~ (bitwise NOT)
It takes one number and inverts all bits of it.

- << (left shift)
It takes 2 numbers. The first operand is number we will take left shift on, the second operand decides the number of digits to shift.

- \>> (right shift)
It takes 2 numbers. The first operand is the number we will take right shif on, the second operand decides the numebr of digits to shift.
