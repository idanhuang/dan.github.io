# Prime Factorization

In number theory, integer factorization is the decomposition of a composite number into a product of smaller integers, which are called factors. If these factors are further ristricted to prime numbers, the process is call prime factorization.

## What is prime number and composite number?
A prime number is a whole number greater than 1, and have and only have two factors: 1 and the number itself.

A composite number is a whole number greater than 1, and has more than two factors.

Prime Numbers are the basic building blocks of all numbers. Composite Numbers are made up of Prime Numbers multiplied together.

## Why 1 is not a prime number?

According to the Unique Prime-Factorization theorem, there is only one unique set of prime factors for any integer greater than 1. If 1 is a prime number, then this theorem is invalid. For example, if 1 is a prime number, then 3 = 3 * 1 = 3 * 1 * 1 = 3 * 1 * 1 * 1 = ...
